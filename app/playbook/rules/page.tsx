Exception: if the receiver doesn't return the ball, then the server may call the fault. The server must call any second serve clearly out." },

      { n: 35, title: "Body movement", body: "A player may fake with the body while a ball is in play. Any movement or sound made solely to distract an opponent (waving arms, stamping feet) is not allowed." },
      { n: 36, title: "Unintentional hindrance", body: "A player hindered by an opponent's unintentional act gets a let only if they could have made the shot. No let is granted for something within the player's own control (e.g., tripping over your own hat)." },

      { n: 41, title: "When to contact an official", body: "Contact an official for: stalling, flagrant foot faults, extreme grunting, medical timeouts, scoring disputes, or a pattern of bad calls. You may refuse to play until an official responds." },
      { n: 45, title: "Equipment malfunction", body: "If clothing or equipment (other than a racket) becomes unusable beyond your control, play may be suspended. For broken rackets, you may replace it but are subject to delay violations." },
